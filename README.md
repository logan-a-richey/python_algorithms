# Python Algorithms

- This repository contains a collection of 67 different algorithms implemented in Python.
- The purpose of this project is to explore different algorithms including sorting, searching, graph theory, dynamic programming, and more.
- Similar algorithms are grouped in a utility class.
- `main.py` runs a demo for each algorithm in each utility class.
